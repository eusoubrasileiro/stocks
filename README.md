## Stocks Prediction
System of Pattern Identification for Future Prediction

Global model (Pytorch NN) so far with 56% error accuray on training. 
Backtesting engine gave 33% accuracy on real orders.

Rules:  
1. Never stay too long on a prototype otherwise you are certainly wrong!  
  Prototype notebooks are just ideas that should soon be transformed in a independent python module.
2. Write unit tests! (lesso learned 4 months wasted)
  Simple and nailing the failure.
