## Stocks Prediction
System of Pattern Identification for Future Prediction

Global model (Pytorch NN) so far with 56% error accuray on training. 
Backtesting engine gave 33% accuracy on real orders.

Wisdom:  
1. Never play too long on a prototype otherwise you are lost!  
  Prototype notebooks are ideas that should soon be transformed in an independent python module for backtesting.
2. Write unit tests! (lessons learned months wasted)
  Simple and nailing the failure.
