### Support and resistence levels

#### Theoretical bases for support and resistence levels:

- Discrete economic hypotheses or scenarios produces deterministic finite price levels. 
- Human emotional behavior, psychology of fear and greed, produces price levels according to Fibonacci.

Future behavior are easier to predict on resistance levels, according to `Wikipedia stock prediction`. Once you label and training using past data? Use Fibonacci retracement on volume. Most day trade or strategies used by traders are based on resistance levels on different time frames (my experience trading/reading thousand blogs)! 

#### The multi-time-scale Market (**personal learning**)

The market is also multi-scale that is multi-time-frame. It's fractal in time. This characteristic can be explored by using different moving averages. The market maybe going up in the yearly scale, e. g. like Brazil recovering from Dilma+Lula's bad administration, but one local event (monthly scale) may produce a big draw down but respecting the up-trend. Collection of events are normally responsible for defining the different trends in different time-scales.

1. 200-day : yearly trend (e.g. 2016-2017 up-trend Brazil economic recovery going to Previdence reform)
2. 50-day : two month trend  
3. 34-day : one and half month trend (e.g. down-trend Joesly day dossier and Micher Temer survival story)
4. 21-day : one month trend (e.g. Joesly day dossier and Micher Temer survival story)
