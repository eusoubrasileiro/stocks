## Stocks Prediction
System for Stock Inefficiency Identification and Movement Prediction

Several tentatives by my head and experience on financial market.
Have used from sklearn, tensorflow to pytorch. Binary options, future contracts and stocks. 
Pandas and written a bunch of code starting in April 2018. 
Have used Metatrader 5 since I figure out my own backtest engine was too much risk and after too many failures. 
An then failures was all I had so far. 

Much and much more than I have learned by myself is written on the book:

[`Advances in Financial Machine Learning`](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B079KLDW21/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_X.J.EbX413CTZ)

I would have save thousands of hours if I had started from it. 
But here we are and now that is my reference and somewhat goal. 

a bit more of self learning wisdom:  
1. Never play too long on a prototype otherwise you are lost!  
  Prototype notebooks are ideas that should soon be transformed in an independent python module for backtesting.
2. Write unit tests! (lessons learned months wasted)
  Simple and nailing the failure.
